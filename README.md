# red-app
A simple standalone web-app for generating a red screen.

This is designed to be used on a mobile phone; essentially it enables you to turn your phone screen into a red light (not as bright, good for things like astronomy).

As to not pollute the display, no directions are shown on the app--it is entirely gesture driven.

## Gestures
- Swipe from Left to Right: Increase brightness
- Swipe from Right to Left: Decrease brightness
- Double Tap: Toggle Lock and Engage (fullscreen)

## App Mode
On android specifically (I'm frankly not sure about any other platform); a `manifest.json` file is present enabling you to **Add to Homescreen**. Doing this is preferred because it will:

1. ensure you can get the fullest of screens (no menu interference)
2. enable the app to work on your device even when you're offline
